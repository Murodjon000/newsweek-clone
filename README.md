# The Newsweek home page clone

A clone of [NewsWeek](https://www.newsweek.com/)'s home page. The website is build using the modern `css` and `bootstrap`. I and my pairing partner have extracted `utility classes` as much as possible for their reusability purposes.

The website is fully responsive with the help of three `media query` `breakpoints` (the default being the smaller viewport), namely: `< 768px`, `>= 768px`, `>= 1024px`, `>= 1280px`.
